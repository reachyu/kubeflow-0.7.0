# Kubeflow Profile

Kubeflow Profile CRD is designed to solve access management within multi-user kubernetes cluster.

Profile access management provides namespace level isolation based on:

- k8s rbac access control
- Istio rbac access control

**Resources managed by profile CRD:**

Each profile CRD will manage one namespace (with same name as profile CRD), and will have one owner.
Specifically, each profile CRD will manage following resources:

- Namespace reserved for profile owner.
- K8s rbac Rolebinding `namespaceAdmin`: make profile owner the namespace admin, allow access to above namespace via k8s API (kubectl).
- Istio namespace-scoped ServiceRole `ns-access-istio`: allow access to all services in target namespace via Istio routing.
- Istio namespace-scoped ServiceRoleBinding `owner-binding-istio`: bind ServiceRole `ns-access-istio` to profile owner. 
So profile owner can access services in above namespace via Istio (browser).
- Setup namespace-scoped service-accounts `editor` and `viewer` to be used by user-created pods in above namespace.
- Resource Quota (since v1beta1)
- Custom Plugins (since v1beta1)

## Supported platforms and prerequisites

**GCP**
- All users should have IAM permission `Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer`
  - This is needed in order to get cluster access by `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`
- kubeflow cluster with version v0.6.2+
- kubeflow cluster ingress is setup with GCP IAP

## Manage access control and resources

**[Detailed document for Kubeflow Multi-Tenancy](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/)**

### manual access management by admin

Cluster admin can manage access management for cluster users:

**To create an isolated namespace `kubeflow-user1` for user `user1@abcd.com`**
- Admin can create a [profile](config/samples/profile_v1beta1_profile.yaml) via kubectl:
```
kubectl create -f /path/to/profile/config
```

**To revoke access to namespace `kubeflow-user1` from user `user1@abcd.com` and delete namespace `kubeflow-user1`**
- Admin can delete profile kubeflow-user1:
```
kubectl delete profile kubeflow-user1
```

### Self-serve kfam UI 

Users with access to cluster API server should be able to register and use kubeflow cluster without admin manual approve.


## Profile v1beta1:

**Profile v1beta1 introduced 2 new customizable fields:**

### ResourceQuotaSpec
Profile now support configuring `ResourceQuotaSpec` as part of profile CR.
- `ResourceQuotaSpec` field will accept standard [k8s ResourceQuotaSpec](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/core/v1#ResourceQuotaSpec)
- A resource quota will be created in target namespace.
- [Example](config/samples/profile_v1beta1_profile.yaml)

### Plugins
Plugins field is introduced to support customized actions based on k8s cluster's surrounding platform.

Consider adding a plugin when you want to have platform-specific logics like managing resources outside k8s cluster.

Plugin interface is defined as:
```$xslt
type Plugin interface {
	// Called when profile CR is created / updated
	ApplyPlugin(*ProfileReconciler, *profilev1beta1.Profile) error
	// Called when profile CR is deleted, to cleanup any non-k8s resources created via ApplyPlugin
	RevokePlugin(*ProfileReconciler, *profilev1beta1.Profile) error
}
```
Plugin owners have full control over plugin spec struct and implementation.

**Available plugins:**
- [WorkloadIdentity](controllers/plugin_workload_identity.go)
  - Platform: GKE
  - Type: credential binding
  - WorkloadIdentity plugin will bind k8s service account to GCP service account, 
  so pods in profile namespace can talk to GCP APIs as GCP service account identity.

## Dev Instruction

##### How to generate Istio rbac CRD types

- We use kube builder https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick_start.html
```
kubebuilder init --domain istio.io --license apache2 --owner "The Kubernetes Authors"
kubebuilder create api --group rbac --version v1alpha1 --kind ServiceRole
kubebuilder create api --group rbac --version v1alpha1 --kind ServiceRoleBinding
```
- Then copy ServiceRole / ServiceRoleBinding schema from Istio release version https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.1.6 to `pkg/apis/istiorbac/v1alpha1/*_types.go`
- Run `make` to update code.
